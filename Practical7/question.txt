Question: 
How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Germany？

The code start at line 71
I found that in the case of Germany, the number of new cases remained low until 12 March 2020，is about 230.
However, after this time, the number of new cases increased rapidly and fluctuated at higher levels.
For the total number of cases in Spain, it has increased rapidly since March 12, 2020.
I think this was because western countries' policy are diffirent from China. They did not pay much attention to the early stage of the epidemic.
Also, due to human rights they can not use strict treatment like lockdown to  prevent isolation.
Defeat of COVID-19 requires the attention of the country and the joint efforts of all the people.
